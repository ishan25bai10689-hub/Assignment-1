# Student Report Card System (Assignment-1)

Hi! Thanks for checking out my project.

This is a straightforward repository where I am storing code for a **Student Report Card System**. This is a Python script that takes student details and marks, calculates their grades, and saves the records for future reference.

I built this because I wanted to practice **Python basics (Input handling, conditional logic, and File I/O)** and see how to manage student data in a simple way.

##  What this project does

* **Automated Grading:** Takes marks for 3 subjects and calculates the average and final grade (A, B, C, D, or Fail).
* **Data Persistence:** Automatically appends every student's record (Name, Reg No, Grade) to a text file named `class_records.txt`.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents the program from crashing if a user enters invalid text instead of numbers.
* **Continuous Loop:** Allows the user to enter multiple students one after another without restarting the program.

## 🛠️ How to run it

If you want to try this out on your own computer, here is exactly what you need to do:

1.  **Download the code:**
    Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP", or run this in your terminal:
    git clone https://github.com/ishan25bai10689-hub/Assignment-1.git

2.  **Open the folder:**
    cd Assignment-1

3.  **Run the script:**
    Since the filename has spaces, make sure to use quotes:
    python "vityarthi project submission.py"

##  File Structure

Here is a quick look at the files so you know where to look:

* `vityarthi project submission.py` - The main Python script containing the logic.
* `class_records.txt` - This file is created automatically to store the student data.
* `README.md` - The file you are reading right now.
